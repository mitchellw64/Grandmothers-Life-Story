    <ul>
      <li><strong>1930: </strong>University of Colorado graduate Gayle McGrimmon welcomes today’s guests as a cruise line hostess. While on her way back to the kitchen, she is stopped by one of the guests, MIT graduate and General Motors Executive Allen Wescott. Through a lot of talking, an unbreakable relationship is formed.</li>
      <li><strong>1933: </strong>Gayle and Allen get married on June 20, 1933. Gayle changes her last name to Wescott.</li>
      <li><strong>1935: </strong>Gayle and Allen’s first child, Cecilia Wescott, is born in New Jersey. Later on, Cecilia determines that she prefers her middle name, Lynn, over Cecilia.
      </li>
      <li><strong>1937: </strong>Lynn’s younger sister, Pat, is born in New Jersey.</li>
      <li><strong>1937-1950: </strong>Over the next few years, Allen and his family are forced to move internationally to Japan and India due to demands at General Motors. While Allen was at work, Gayle would often show Lynn and Pat the greatest sightseeing spots wherever they lived. In this time, Lynn grew a strong passion for Japanese architecture and art, which will influence her love for traveling the world later on in her life. Eventually, the family landed in their more permanent residency on the eastern shore of Virginia, on the “DelMarVa” peninsula.
      </li>
      <li><strong>1944: </strong>Lynn’s younger brother, Tom, is born in Virginia.

      <li><strong>1953-1957: </strong>Lynn attends William & Mary, a small public research university in Williamsburg, Virginia. The university is the second oldest in the United States, being founded before the country became independent from Britain. Throughout these amazing four years, Lynn would become very well known, as she worked her way up to becoming the president of her sorority, Delta Delta Delta.
      </li>
      <li><strong>1957: </strong>Lynn graduates with an Associate’s Degree in Interior Design at William & Mary.</li>

      <li><strong>1959: </strong>During her time at the interior design school, Lynn went on a few double dates. On a double date between her current boyfriend and one of Lynn’s friends, she met her friend's date, John Johnson Jr. He was a Navy veteran and at the time, an employee at the advertising company Benton and Bowles Inc. Despite Lynn liking her current boyfriend, she couldn’t help but get feelings for John. Coincidentally, John felt the same way. So a few days later, Lynn and John broke up with their dates and began an everlasting relationship with each other. John decides to go by the nickname Buddy. Six months later, Lynn and Buddy rented an apartment together in the city.</li>
      <li><strong>1960: </strong>On February 6, 1960, Lynn and Buddy get married on the Eastern shore of Virginia. Lynn starts working at General Reinsurance.

On many weekends while the kids were occupied, Lynn would volunteer setting up tournaments for the nine-holers at Scarsdale Golf Club.
